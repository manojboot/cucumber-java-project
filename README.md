Powerful Construct
We can use datatable to write highly reusable and compact test scenario
A data table is designed to handle scenarios where a large number of parameters need to be passed. Splitting the steps is technically correct, but it may not be the best way to pass multiple parameters. If your step has 50 parameters, 
you will have to introduce 50 steps, thereby making your feature file less readable and maintainable.
